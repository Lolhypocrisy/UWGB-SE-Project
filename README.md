# UWGB-SE-Project
Sorting algorithm visualization tool for Software Engineering class

A sorting algorithm tool that was developed for the spring 2017 semester software engineering class at UWGB. The user has the ability to view how different sorting algorithms work, as well as the code for the algorithms in one of 5 different languages.

Also included is a testing screen, where the user can input their own integer data, and have the algorithms sort the data and return the amount of time it took each algorithm.
